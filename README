This is a 2 player game called Battle Tanks that I created as a school project.  It is written in Python, and utilizes Tkinter,the built in GUI.  I have also used the Pmw 1.3 library to create more complex widgets on the Tkinter module.

The objective of the game is to select a weapon and choose an appropriate angle/power combination that will hit the 
opponent, in order to recieve points. Each weapon has different properties like explosion size, explosion kick, amount of
bullets fired, and point value. More accurate shots are given more points, and easier weapons like the machine gun which
fires multiple bullets, are awarded less points.  Each player can only move their tank 5 times throughout the game.
May the best shooter win!
